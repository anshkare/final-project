# kobe-project
In this project I analyze Kobe Bryant's career as a basketball player. He is known for being a ball-hog, so i wanted to know what would increase Kobe's chances to pass in a game. Using a public dataset analyzing his games and stats, I found 3 significant factors that influence him to pass more.
